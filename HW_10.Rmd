### Homework 10

#### Objective
The goal of this exercise is to create a function that pulls CO2 per capita data from gapminder for a given country in a given year. Then, to give it a "grade" compared to other countries that year and improve the function to be more user friendly.   

#### Packages Used
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
```

#### Data Used
`co2_emissions_tonnes_per_person_gapminder.csv`

#### Usage
The function is called `per_capita_co2`. The call for the function is `per_capita_co2("Country", year)`.

#### Languages Used
* R

#### Products
Example: CO2 report for China in 2001
```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("HW_10.R")
per_capita_co2("China", 2001)
```
--- do we need to add return in the function?
